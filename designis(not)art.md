There’s timeless debate about and art, whether design is an art form or not. Design unlike art has clear dos and don’ts, right and wrongs but at the same time it is subjective. People will have their own opinions on which types of design are better and which types are worst. This situation reminds me of the three blind men and the elephant. They all touch different parts of the elephant and think it is all different animals. Just like this story people who argue whether design is art or not are really missing the bigger question. How do you make good design and what is design to begin with? This all ties back to the question what design patterns are and how do I use them. In software engineering the four most common types of design patterns are the factory, singleton, observer, and model-view-controller. All these design patterns are all different, but they all share a common trait. They all have pros and cons. The factory can return objects from different class and multiple objects and can build dependent objects but are complicated. The singleton uses global variables, making them very easy but are considered unsafe and unwise. The observer allows an open-ended number of dependencies and allows them to change during run time but can lead to performance issues, race conditions in multi-threaded systems and can be hard to debug. The model-view-controller splits the different aspects of software engineering into three categories but is complex and has a steep learning curve. Design is much like art as where one’s progress much like a road as traditional subjects like math and science where they constantly build off each other. There comes a point in design and art where designers and artist find themselves banging their head on the same wall as their teachers. Its just that we are taught the most effective ways to do it (if there ever was such a thing as efficient hand banging). In the artist’s case they are looking for the most elegant ways. All designers will find themselves facing the same problems as all artists will find themselves facing the same canvas.
