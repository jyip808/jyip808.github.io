I think Javascript is very similar to Java. To me this is a good thing because since I learned Java in ICS 111, it makes Javascript feel very familiar. Some new things I learned was how ES6 helps make Javascript more versatile as a language through let and const. And how you can create objects with different properties. I wouldn't know if Javascript would be a good or bad langauge from a software engineering persepective but I think it would be good because I feel that the language is very versatile. I find the WODs to be useful because it gives good practice on using the language since I just learned the language recently. I don't find coding to be stressful but nor do I find it to be particularly enjoyable. 

I do think the knowlage of the language will be useful even though I do not know when and where I would be using it. Hopefully
in the future I do learn a use for Javascript because I do think that it is a language that is very adaptable and it has ease of use. In addition since it is a widely
used language there are a lot of guides and documentation on it so that if I ever do need help coding, I can easily find resources and answers online. Being able to
easily find answers to my questions for a particular language is something I find very valuable since I'm bound to run into many issues or problems in the future.
