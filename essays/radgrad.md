Naviagting through college to me is like driving a car. I don't have a permit, I'm on the freeway, my brakes are broken, and im driving a 2001 Toyota Corolla. I'm 
require to have forsight of my near and far future while trying to pass my classes that are already giving me a big enough migrane to split my skull in half. Bottom line
it is not fun. Me two years ago was right to not be excited for college. I still have little time to enjoy doing what I want and little energy to spend doing the work I
want. I will take any help I can get big or small. Radgrad is an web application that helps ICS students classes. Recently I finally got to try it, after hearing it 
sparingly from emails and teachers. I find it kinda strange why this kinda application wasn't described to me more in depth in the past. I think has the potential to be
a very helpful tool. I don't want to sound rude or harsh about this program since I didn't make it and the people who did, did a great job making it. But there are some
quriks I have with it. 

First, the program seems to have little exposure. Apart from the emails and professors who very breifly mention the program I wasn't explain to at all that it was a 
planner. I only figured out what kinda of application it was after using it. I think the fact that it is a planner should be the main selling point. But the fact that
it is a planner is also a down side. It has very similar functionality like Star except that it is more focus and oritanted for ICS students. It has a lot of features
I wish Star had. So its presence is needed and justified. But at the same time I wish I didn't need to log into a seperate website to use its tools.
