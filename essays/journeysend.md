In ICS 314 I learned a lot. I learned about programming in HTML, JavaScript, React, the meteor application platform, and mongo databases. I think the most important 
things I learned in my class was the meteor application platform and the mongo databases. The meteor application platform taught me about design patterns in software 
engineering. Design patterns are techniques that software engineers use to create their applications. The meteor application platform allows use different languages 
and the organizes the user interface and the database, such as mongo, so that they are easy to implement and use collectively. I think these were the most important 
because I have never used anything like them before in the past and that they are applicable to many things in the future when I design and create applications. 
Almost every application will store data in some way and knowing how to collect that data save it and then call it back is a core concept. In addition, knowing an 
efficient way to do so is even more important. As an aspiring game developer knowing these concepts will be important since I will need to know how to apply similar 
frameworks in the future. Many games have players make accounts, in my class we learned how to create a login interface and mange accounts that were created using 
meteor and mongo. 

Being familiar with design patterns like Meteor was also very helpful because in the future I will encounter other types of frameworks that will utilize similar patterns.
For example, the game engine unity uses a factory type design pattern making use of components, which are set objects with different types of properties already tied to 
them. Being able to recognize and using these patterns are important because many game engines will use these patterns. Being able to understand these patterns will 
allow me to use the engine better and maybe one day be able to create my own engine. This class allowed me to dip my toes into the water and gain valuable insight on 
to how create applications, databases, and how to use design patterns in software engineering. 
The final project in class was a group project which was also done in meteor. Working in a group was also a insightful experience since we used github to collabratively work on the project together. This was my first time working on a application in a group using github. This allowed me to experience how to use githubs boards and issues. I'm almost certain that this won't be my last time using github to make an application so the experience using github was very eye opening.
