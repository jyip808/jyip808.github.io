Have you ever tried to format a word document with a photo in it? When you move the photo just one line up or down your whole document gets shifted and now you have ten blank pages. Your scared, confused, and frustrated. Styling in HTML can be like word document. It's hard and frustrating to make a website look like you want it too and it's even harder to make a website that looks right on every machine. With the usage of frameworks can greatly relieve headaches. Frameworks are basically what they sound like, tools that help you build your site. Recently, I’ve had the chance to use Semantic UI and there is a big difference between building a site with and without it. Frameworks help format your website so that there is seamless consistency between machines and browsers. There are also some helpful tools that are a huge quality of life change. For example, icons, Semantic UI uses a font that makes commonly used icons easy to implement. Icons, like Facebook, twitter, Instagram, and discord to name a few. Making it so that if you’d wanted to link any social media to a site it would be easy. Also, another handy tool is implementing menus. Semantic UI gives a lot of options and styles so that you can create a menu that fits your website.
