My passion is in video game design. I just don't want to make games that are just fun but also convey intresting and meaningfull theme's and narratives. Game design
and software engineering have a lot in common, for starters both involve design. Both software engineering and game design both involve design that is made and used by
users. Ultimately all types of design have a similar process. Learning and practicing software engineering will help improve the skills I apply in game design. They will
not only help me when I code for game design but also when designing systems and mechanics for those games. Design is one of the skills I hope to expereience and develop
in the future.

In particular one of the types of design that I hope to expereience and develop is user interface design. In my opinon user interfaces are one of the most important
types of design in both software engineering and game design. Making a UI that is both easy to navigate and conveys all the information you need is challenge. Through
software engineering I hope to get practice and experience making UIs. 

Another skill I hope to develop in the future is AI programming. Many games have some sort of AI thats plays against or with the player. Having a good AI system can
greatly improve the quality and fun of a game. Sometimes AAA games lack a good AI system causing the games quality to drop severaly. Learning and applying a good AI
is one of my future goals in software engineering.
