My first week of using ESLint was more negative than positive. At first I found it tedious too keep changing my settings and installing ESLink into every new project.
This pain was added upon when I was still trying to figure out Intellij and understand how to use it. My biggest grip was trying to fix a issue with declare a 
variable/let/const. I do think that coding standards are important so that code is more easily read by other people other than yourself. But I do think it doesn't
need to be so rigiously enforced. When fixing your code because of coding standards becomes an issue of itself is where I would start to draw the line.
In addition, we all have different view on how code should be formatted. ESLint forces a the first curly braket to be on the same line as a fuction, if statment,
or loop.  I personally like to give each curly braket its own line. I just think its easier to read. But other people and ESLint might think else. 

I think as long as someones code can be easily understood and read without making any changes to it should be the standard for coding practices. I see it almost as like
formating when writing a written document. It's expected of you to have proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Having bad grammar or misspelling a word and lead to
your writing being misunderstood or not understood at all. I feel that this is the same with coding. Proper coding should be a standard with every program written. But 
like writing everyone has their own way of writing. So applying this back to coding, since everyone has their own ways of creating code. Where it be naming variable, or 
the placement of curly brakets, it shouldn't be so rigorously regulated that it takes a large amount of time and effort to comply with the coding standards.
