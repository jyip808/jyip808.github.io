Have you ever tried to format a word document with a photo in it? When you move the photo just one line up or down your whole document gets shifted and now you have ten blank pages. Your scared, confused, and frustrated. Styling in HTML can be like word document. It's hard and frustrating to make a website look like you want it too and it's even harder to make a website that looks right on every machine. 

With the usage of frameworks can greatly relieve headaches. Frameworks are basically what they sound like, tools that help you build your site. Recently, I’ve had the chance to use Semantic UI and there is a big difference between building a site with and without it. Frameworks help format your website so that there is seamless consistency between machines and browsers. There are also some helpful tools that are a huge quality of life change. For example, icons, Semantic UI uses a font that makes commonly used icons easy to implement. Icons, like Facebook, twitter, Instagram, and discord to name a few. Making it so that if you’d wanted to link any social media to a site it would be easy. Also, another handy tool is implementing menus. 

Semantic UI gives a lot of options and styles so that you can create a menu that fits your website.  If I had to use raw HTML and CSS to make a website, I’d spend way too many hours trying to get the padding and margins right and in about the third hour in I would probably give up and take an anger nap. The main point of frameworks in my opinion is the amount of time it saves. I think we all can agree we want to work less and get more done, and frameworks is the solution to that problem, for HTML and CSS. 

Before using Semantic UI, I have never coded in HTML and CSS, which to my relief was easier to learn than expected. No to my relief was how difficult it was to get spacing, and formatting correct. This was an entirely new learning experience for me, and it was an eye opener. I’m almost certain that in the future I will have to design and create my own website so learning this was a huge plus for me and future me.
