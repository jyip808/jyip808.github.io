I think Javascript is very similar to Java. To me this is a good thing because since I learned Java in ICS 111, it makes Javascript feel very familiar. Some new things I learned was how ES6 helps make Javascript more versatile as a language through let and const. And how you can create objects with different properties. I wouldn't know if Javascript would be a good or bad langauge from a software engineering persepective but I think it would be good because I feel that the language is very versatile. I find the WODs to be useful because it gives good practice on using the language since I just learned the language recently. I don't find coding to be stressful but nor do I find it to be particularly enjoyable. I do think the knowlage of the language will be useful even though I do not know when and where I would be using it.
