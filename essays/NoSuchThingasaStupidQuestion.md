Asking questions is a staple of learning and improvement, and knowing how to ask questions correctly is an important skill. If a question isn't asked in a smart way,
it potentinally might not be answered or the answer won't be very beneficial. Asking smart question is very important to a software engineer because software engineering
can be a hard and confusing and asking questions is the fastest way to learn and improve as a software engineer. 

The following is an good example of how to ask a question. Here the user states the two programs they are using and the issue they are experiencing. In the description 
the user provides a gif showing the issue visually and also provides useful information such as the version of the two programs and fact that they do have a necessary
data pack installed. This user is correctly asking question because they are clear and concise and also uses a visual aid to provide an example of the issue.

The following is a bad example of how to ask a question. This user starts their question with "This is probably a beginners question." instead of going directly into
thier question. This is an example of meaningless words. In addition, they also state their use of unity at the end of their description. This is context is important to the question and putting it at the end doesn't help responders.
