An Answer for the Dust is a top down roguelike shooter where players must protect their sister from an ever increasing horde of zombies. In between the waves of zombies players can spend their coins they earned from killing zombies from the last round. Players can buy items from a shop that randomly spawns 3 items from a collection of 30 unique items. They also can buy a weapon from a pool of 8 different guns. In addition, unique power ups have a chance of dropping from fallen zombies. For this project I created the majority of the sprites except for the zombies, and I programmed most of the mechanics in the game except for the boss.

An Answer for the Dust was inspired by other survivor-like roguelike games. To build off the traditional mechanics featured in these games, An Answer for the Dust features a sister character that the player must protect as she follows the player around. In addition, the game is split into seven days and in between each of the days the player is granted access to the shop. Money to spend at the shop is dropped by zombies. Players are forced to choose between leaving their sister behind to collect much needed cash or to stay near her to protect her. Players then must carefully spend their cash. They are given the option to buy items and new weapons or restore much needed health.
