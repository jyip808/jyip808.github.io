An Answer for the Dust is a top down rougelike shooter where players must protect their sister from a ever increasing horde of zombies. In between the waves of zombies players can spend their coins they earned from killing zombies from the last round. Players can buy items from a shop that randomly spawns 3 items from a collection of 30 unique items. They also can buy a weapon from a pool of 8 different guns. In addition, unique power ups have a chance of droping from fallen zombies. For this project I created majority of the sprites except for the zombies, and I programmed most of the mechanics in the game except for the boss.
