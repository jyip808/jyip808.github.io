summary: My Personal Projects in Video game design.
---


I've worked on several different video game projects with my friend. These projects were created in Unity and coded in C#. My friend would do the art and graphics.
While I would do build the project in the engine, do the coding, and do gameplay design. These projects are still a work in progress, but I personally am proud of my
progress. I first started working in Unity in high school before I had taken any programming class. I had no idea how to code or how to use Unity and completely learned
how to use the engine and how to code from various youtube videos. These projects are not released to the public and I hope to release them when they are completed.

I'll breifly share the current project I am working. The project I am currently working on is titled Homebound. It originally started as the final project for my ICS 111 
class and this is a continuation/redo of the same project. It carries the same ideas and themes over but the delivery is completely different. The games main theme is to
explore the meaning of a home. My goal is to convey this theme through purely through visual storytelling and game mechanics. 

The players plays as a lone astronaunt who has landed on a planet with previous inhabitants are no where to be found. The only sign of life is a single cat. The player 
explores the planet with the cat to find the reason why all of its inhabitants are missing. The player controls both the cat and the astronaunt to solve puzzles.
Both characters "vision" will slowly decrease but will return to normal when they are both near each other. This "vision" is representative of feelings of comfort and
home. And is an example of conveying the games themes through game mechanics.
