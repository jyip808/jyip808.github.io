Homebound originally started as the final project for my ICS 111 
class and this is a remake of the same project. It carries the same ideas and themes over but the delivery is completely different. The games main theme is to
explore the meaning of a home. My goal is to convey this theme through purely through visual storytelling and game mechanics. 

The players plays as a lone astronaunt who has landed on a planet with previous inhabitants are no where to be found. The only sign of life is a single cat. The player 
explores the planet with the cat to find the reason why all of its inhabitants are missing. The player controls both the cat and the astronaunt to solve puzzles.
Both characters have a bubble of "vision" which will slowly decrease over time but will return back to normal size when they are both near each other. This "vision" is representative of feelings of comfort and
home. Since the goal of game is to convey a meaningful story non diegetically the enviroment and game mechanics need to carry the emotional weight of
story being presented.
