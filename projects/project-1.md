summary: My Personal Projects in Video game design.
---


I've worked on several different video game projects with my friend. These projects were created in Unity and coded in C#. My friend would do the art and graphics.
While I would do build the project in the engine, do the coding, and do gameplay design. These projects are still a work in progress, but I personally am proud of my
progress. I first started working in Unity in high school before I had taken any programming class. I had no idea how to code or how to use Unity and completely learned
how to use the engine and how to code from various youtube videos.
