summary: My Personal Projects in Video game design.
---


I've worked on several different video game projects with my friend. These projects were created in Unity and coded in C#. My friend would do the art and graphics.
While I would do build the project in the engine, do the coding, and do gameplay design. These projects are still a work in progress, but I personally am proud of my
progress. I first started working in Unity in high school before I had taken any programming class. I had no idea how to code or how to use Unity and completely learned
how to use the engine and how to code from various youtube videos. These projects are not released to the public and I hope to release them when they are completed.

The current project I am working on is titled Homebound. It originally started as the final project for my ICS 111 class and this is a continuation/redo of the same 
project. It carries the same ideas and themes over but the delivery is completely different.
