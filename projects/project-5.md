summary: Cleansweep is an arcade topdown house management game created for black and white jam 2022
---

Clean sweep was made for the black and white jam 2022. The theme of the jam is to only use the colors black and white. I made this game with the University of 
Manoa game development club. The game was made with Unity and I worked on coding some of the mini games, designed game mechanics, and made some art for the 
game. This game was made in 14 days. For this game jam we were able to complete the enitre game and completed all that we set out to accomplish. The game was
simple but the art style gave it a charm that complemented the gameplay. If I could improve the game I would improve the game mechanics. I would like to add 
more mechanics that would give the game more depth or create another level with different mechanics in the same vain.
