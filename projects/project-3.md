At the Laboratory for Advanced Visualizations and Applications (LAVA) I am assigned to work on a project contracted by the Hawaii State Energy Office (HSEO) to develop a virtual reality tour. The tour takes users around to all the energy locations around the island. The tour also includes future projects such as the offshore windfarm and expanded solar farm. My work involves the filming of 360 videos of the featured locations and adding them into the application. I also created the user interface and designed the flow of user navigation.

To make the app more appealing a Jettsons theme was adopted. The app also features user friendly controls with the only one button used on the controller to navigate the app. The 360 videos shot are stereoscopic creating the perception of depth. The locations of the site are indicated by pins. Users can click these area pins to zoom into that location which will reveal pins that allow users to navigate to 360 videos or an aerial scene that utilizes google map tiles. The goal of the project is to provide the public a realistic view of these energy sites.
