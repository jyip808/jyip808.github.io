summary: Helped the creationa and funding of a $400,000 project on Kaiser High School
---

In my junior and senior years of high school I worked on project for creating a new location for students to gather. The goal was to create a place where students can 
gather, study, and relax in a central location on campus. Working within the student goverment class, we spoke to experts, professionals, and engineer's to get and idea
and cost of the scope of the project. My role as the technology coordinator lead me to create the design and look of the project. I created a visual representation
through photoshop. This visual was used when presenting the project to others. Our efforts lead us to presenting the project to our local representatives and senator.
Through our lobbying and with the help of our representatives and senators we were able to raise $400,000 for the project.
